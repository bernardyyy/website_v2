      "Irmao is a vibrant beach club and wellness center on the Costa da Caparica, Portugal, known for its bohemian-luxurious atmosphere, with handcrafted design, DJs, sports, gastronomy and a focus on art, creativity and diversity, being a place to relax, enjoy the sun, and events to enjoy with music and good vibes by the sea.",
      "At its heart, the brand is joyful and expressive, never taking itself too seriously. There's a sense of playful irreverence and unexpected moments that spark curiosity and delight. Beneath that lightness lives confidence and sensuality of Irmao: bold, rockstar energy balanced with emotional warmth. Family, music, and environmental awareness. Ensuring that Irmão feels inclusive, culturally fluent, and socially conscious."

      "From the river Taboão to the stone-paved streets, every detail speaks to a place that doesn't try to be more than it is — and that's its strength. The result is an identity that moves gently, confidently, always in harmony with the village it represents. Coura is just Coura, and nothing else."

      "\"A Designer at the End of the Dream Career\" is a self-published book reflecting on the non-linear paths designers face as they begin their professional journeys. Developed in the final semester of the Communication Design degree, it explores the symbolic and practical weight of reaching the end of academic life.",
      "The project began with a prompt: \"A Designer at the End of…\". Each group completed the phrase in their own way, contributing an 8-page chapter that expressed personal and collective reflections. The task was then to bring them together under a shared theme, The Dream Career: the thrill of starting out, the disillusionment that can follow, and the hope that keeps us moving forward.",
      "A unifying visual identity was created to connect all contributions, drawing from diagrams, maps, and charts as a nod to the soul-searching that shapes every designer's path. Physically, the publication itself is divided into three interwoven chapters, inviting readers to choose their own entry point—mirroring the unpredictable nature of creative careers.",
      "Printed with the faculty's Risograph machine and fully produced by hand—folded, stapled, and trimmed in the design lab—it was released in a limited run of 100 copies, each with a distinct, tactile quality."

With a pop and modernist language, the circles scattered throughout the pages represent the mold and assume a role of authority as they infiltrate the paragraphs of each chapter. The condensed sans-serif typeface is paired with a classic serif, contributing to an identity that is both contemporary and timeless.",
